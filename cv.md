## About me  
Hello, I am a beginner front-end developer. Unfortunately I do not have extensive experience in front-end development, but I am constantly improving my skills by learning new technologies and approaching my work and tasks with maximum responsibility. My main goal is to continue growing as a front-end developer by learning new technologies and methodologies. In my free time, I enjoy relaxing, participating in sports, going for walks or gym, spending time with friends, and of course, learning new technologies, and practicing, practicing, practicing :smile:
